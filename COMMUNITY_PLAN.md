The digital content space is one that keeps growing year after year where platforms such as YouTube and Spotify have become the perennial industry leaders. With Tron’s acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) in early 2019, our goals are in-line to provide excellent value for the community and the overall value of Tron and its native TRX token. 

VibraVid is being built using the BitTorrent protocol it will bring value to both services and increase the total user base. Listeners/views of VibraVid content will help by seeding while they are using the platform which further provides incentives for BTT and BeatzCoin (BTZC).

Until the launch of VibraVid’s minimum viable product (MVP) the intent is to make a reward structure which supersedes all other candidates.
