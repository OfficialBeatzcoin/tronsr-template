The digital content space is one that keeps growing year after year where platforms such as YouTube and Spotify have become the perennial industry leaders. With Tronâ€™s acquisition of BitTorrent (BTT) in early 2019, our goals are in-line to provide excellent value for the community and the overall value of Tron and its native TRX token. 

The VibraVid platform, powered by our native token BeatzCoin (BTZC), is the perfect decentralized app for the Tron blockchain - empowering artists and content creators by offering a direct link between creators and users, thereby facilitating a new peer-2-peer economy.

VibraVid is being built using the BitTorrent File System (BTFS), and will bring value to both services and increase the total user base.
